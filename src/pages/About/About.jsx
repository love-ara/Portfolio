                <h6 >I am a software engineer with a focus on backend development, skilled in Java, Python, Golang, and
                    frameworks like Spring Boot and Django. While my passion lies in building scalable backend systems,
                    I have a solid foundation in React.js and DevOps practices, ensuring end-to-end delivery of robust
                    applications.

                As an economics graduate, I bring strong analytical and problem-solving skills, and I'm eager to
